The participants often related back to the stress of menarche\\nand said their period negatively impacted their wellbeing their whole lives. During perimenopause, their periods had\\nbecome unpredictable, heavy, and a debilitating disruption to their lives. The women desired support at work through\\npolicy, and from family and friends. They believed that educating girls and boys during school was the best place to start, but\\nthat education through work and community groups was also needed. They felt healthcare professionals should have\\nmandatory training regarding women’s health issues and menopause.\\nConclusion: The study highlights the impact of menstrual experiences on the wellbeing of perimenopausal women,\\nemphasising the need for improved menstrual education from an early age. Comprehensive menstrual education in schools\\ninvolving both genders to enable informed decision-making and improved training for healthcare professionals are\\nrecommended. Support networks for perimenopausal women will promote better quality of life for women as they go\\nthrough their perimenopause journey.\\nKeywords\\nPerimenopause, period, menstruation, heavy, wellbeing, unpredictable\\nIntroduction\\nMost women experience menstrual cycles between men-\\narche and menopause.1 Menarche begins around 12 years\\nold for girls in the UK, but can start between 8 and 17 years2\\nMenstruation is cyclic shedding of the uterine lining that\\nand occurs approximately every 24–38 days and lasts up to\\n8 days, though both menstrual cycle and bleeding length can\\nvary from month to month and between individuals.3 The\\nmenstrual cycle begins on the ﬁrst day of menstrual\\nbleeding and lasts until the day before the next period\\nbegins.2 Menopause is deﬁned as a year after the ﬁnal\\nmenstrual period (FMP).4,5 On average, menopause occurs\\nbetween ages 45 and 55, with the UK’s average being\\n51 years.6,7 After menopause, a woman is postmenopausal.\\nSome women’s quality of life (QoL) and wellbeing are\\nsigniﬁcantly impacted by their period. Often, the initial\\nepisode of menses shapes perception and management\\nthroughout their lives – many have negative experiences\\naround their menstruation.8,9\\nNote, in this paper we will use the term women, as the\\nfocus groups included only cis women. A separate study\\nneeds to be done with trans, non-binary and gender diverse\\npeople.\\n1UCL EGA Institute for Women’s Health, University College London,\\nLondon, UK\\n2Centre for Reproductive Health, Institute for Regeneration and Repair,\\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK\\nCorresponding author:\\nJoyce C Harper, UCL EGA Institute for Women’s Health, University\\nCollege London, 86-96 Chenies Mews, London, WC1E 6HX, UK.\\nEmail:joyce.harper@ucl.ac.uk')"
